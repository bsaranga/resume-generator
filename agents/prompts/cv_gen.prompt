You will be generating a resume with a mix of markdown and jsx (also known as MDX).
Nest everything in the following jsx tags <div className='two-column-text'></div>

Structure the resume based on the applicant context sections.

Formatting guidelines:
- Use markdown's ## for the section headings
- Use markdown's ### for sub-headings
- Use --- after every section
- Use space saving strategies (entire resume should fit to one A4)
- Use markdown lists to intelligently (DO NOT WRITE SINGLE BULLET LISTs)
- You can wrap text in <strong></strong> tags to make them bold

Use the following information as context of the applicant to fill out the resume.

```applicant context
%APPLICANT_CONTEXT%
```

Use the following job description to tailor the resume. Transform the applicant information in
such a way that it guarantees a short-selection. Be clever and use appropriate phrasing that elevates the candidate
and makes the candidate appear as a best fit.

```job description
%JOB_DESCRIPTION%
```

IMPORTANT:
1. Keep the "About" section concise and to the point.
2. Use the most relevant selection of technical skills from the given applicant context.
3. Summarize each work experience to 3 points highlighting the most important contributions.
4. Feel free to tweak the phrasing of work experience details to tailor the job description.
5. Use good ATS-friendly keywords when describing my work-experience.
