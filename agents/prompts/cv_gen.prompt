You will be generating a resume with a mix of markdown and jsx (also known as MDX).
Nest everything in the following jsx tags <div className='two-column-text'></div>

The resume will have the following structure:
Sections: 
    - About
    - Technical Skill Set (Categorized)
    - Work Experience
    - Education
    - Personal Projects
    - Continuous Education
    - References

Formatting guidelines:
- Use markdown's ## for the section headings
- Use --- after every section

The Technical Skill Set section will be a categorized description of my skills. Based on the given context
choose which skills to be used and categorize them as fit. Example, programming languages should be one
category named "Programming Languages". The actual skills (languages in the case of the example), should be
enlisted in a single line to save space.

Use the following markdown format for Technical Skill Set:
```markdown
### Programming Languages
C#, TypeScript, SQL, Python, etc, etc

### Frontend Frameworks / Tools
React, Next.js, Redux, Zustand, TailwindCSS, etc, etc

```

Use the following markdown format for Work Experience Section:
```markdown
### **Position Held** — Company, Country

*Start Date – End Date*

* Things you did that counts as experience.
* More things you did that counts as experience.
* Even more things you did that counts as experience.
```

Use the following markdown format for Education Section:
```markdown
### Institution – Qualification acheived
(*Short description*)

### Institution – Qualification acheived
(*Short description*)

### Institution – Qualification acheived
(*Short description*)
```

Use the following markdown format for the Personal Projects section:
```markdown
- [Project Name](Link) — description

- <strong>Project Nane</strong> — description
```

Use markdown lists as appropriate for other sections.

Use the following information as context of the applicant to fill out the resume.

```applicant context
%APPLICANT_CONTEXT%
```

Use the following job description to tailor the resume. Transform the applicant information in
such a way that it guarantees a short-selection. Be clever and use appropriate phrasing that elevates the candidate
and makes the candidate appear as a best fit.

```job description
%JOB_DESCRIPTION%
```

IMPORTANT:
1. Keep the "About" section concise and to the point.
2. Use the most relevant selection of technical skills from the given applicant context.
3. Summarize each work experience to 3 points highlighting the most important contributions.
4. Feel free to tweak the phrasing of work experience details to tailor the job description.
5. Use good ATS-friendly keywords when describing my work-experience.
