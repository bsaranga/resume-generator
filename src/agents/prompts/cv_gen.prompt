You will be generating a resume with a mix of markdown and jsx (also known as MDX).
Nest everything in the following jsx tags <div className='two-column-text'></div>

Start with an about section using the info in metadata.
Structure the rest of the resume based on other applicant context sections.

Formatting guidelines:
- Always use markdown syntax
- Use markdown's ## for the section headings
- Use markdown's ### for sub-headings
- Use --- after every section
- Use space saving strategies (entire resume should fit to one A4)
- Use markdown lists to intelligently (DO NOT WRITE SINGLE BULLET LISTs)
- If you want to emphasize something, use <strong></strong> tags.

Use the following information as context of the applicant to fill out the resume.

```applicant context
%APPLICANT_CONTEXT%
```

Use the following job description to tailor the resume. In order to write the resume sections, select the best applicant information in
such a way that it stands out to the recruiter. Be clever and use appropriate phrasing that makes the candidate a best fit for the
given job description.

```job description
%JOB_DESCRIPTION%
```

IMPORTANT:
1. Keep the "About" section concise and to the point.
2. Summarize each work experience to 3 points highlighting the most important contributions.
3. Feel free to tweak the phrasing of work experience details to tailor the job description.
4. Use good ATS-friendly keywords when describing my work-experience.
